## Overview

Cake is a modified Quake 2 based game engine built on top of the Quake 2 source code released by id Software.

I plan on using Cake as a basis for building first person games for myself and hopefully others will fork the engine and use it for their own needs.

I am not finished working on Cake, so bug reports are very much welcome. 

## Downloads

Preview releases of _Cake_ for all platforms are not quite available just yet.

## Compiling

Cake builds with CMake. If you've never tried it, please do so, it rocks.

## Installing

To have a working game, you must install the game data into the baseq2 folder. 
All that is required is a copy of the full retail version of Quake 2. That is pak0.pak, pak1.pak, and pak2.pak.

Cake requires SDL 2 to be installed or available on your system to function.
If on Windows, that usually just requires putting SDL2.dll next to the main engine exe.
